Enquire today for a monthly quote, Lease, PCP, Contract Hire or Purchase - we are unbeatable in the UK with short (weeks) lead in times.
Karlsen Auto Design have a penchant for Pick-Ups. Having run, used and retailed many Pick-ups over the years, we fell for the Navara. For over 80 Years Nissan have been placing masses of research and development into their pick-ups.
We have been retsiling the D40 Navara since new in 2006 with Nissans D40 model. This has proven to be not only an excellent seller for ourselves. It was a pick up clients used and appreciated for week/weekend use.
Now with the all new Euro 6 2.3L NP300 things have just got even better. Mercedes thought so too by partnering with Nissan to use their chassis and coachwork for their first pick-up coming in late 2017 in the guise of the new X-Class.&amp;nbsp;
Mercedes naturally went to the best in the market for pick-ups in the Nissan Navara. The Mercedes X-Class will be considerably more expensive with a styled Mercedes front and rear end (prices yet to be released).&amp;nbsp;
If you're looking for a one-tonne 4x4 pick-up, your decision has gotten quite a bit harder in recent times. New models from several different brands have been coming off production lines thick and fast. With manufacturers marketing them more like glamorous lifestyle vehicles than just a tool.
But a glamorous lifestyle vehicle will be quickly laughed off the building site if it can't handle more than a sprinkling of mud, and as Nissan has been making pick-ups for more than 80 years, it would be poor form if the latest Navara couldn't handle itself. Recent successes with the Qashqai, Juke and X-Trail means that the Navara&amp;nbsp;pick-up is said to be a combination of these two knowledge bases: a tough, off-roading, working truck with the refined road manners of a crossover.
Dont take our word for it. The NP300 won Pick-up of the Year 2016.&amp;nbsp;https://goo.gl/us95FM
Pictured here is one such NP300 Tekna Connect we have just supplied. This vehicle is a NEW 66 plate (Private Plate in images). The NP300 went to one very happy client with both price and service. Plus a quick lead in time. We also took their 2007 - D40 Navara in Part exchange.
Enquire today regarding our unbeatable deals. For Contract Hire, Fleet bulk buys, Personal Credit plan or straight out purchase.&amp;nbsp;
You choose your colour and specification the NP300 will come with Delivery mileage. We will price your part exchange and allow you to drive that until your new NP300 is ready. We operate a FREE UK delivery service. Hassle free service." />
