<p style="text-align: justify;">The new NP300... It makes personal and business sense.... Having identified the 2006 onwards D40 Navara as a retail vehicle for ourselves. The all new Navara NP300 is stunning.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With Mercedes launching the X-Class pickup in late 2017. Mercedes&nbsp;chose to partner with Nissan. Nissan have allowed Mercedes to use their new NP300 as their vehicle of choice. The X Class will be much more expensive with a styled Mercedes front and rear end. Although you can clearly tell Mercedes went straight for Nissan as they are simply the best pickup manufacturers around. Stylish loooks coupled with freat engines and options. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you're looking for a one-tonne 4x4 pick-up, your decision has gotten quite a bit harder in recent times. New models from several different brands have been sprouting out like weeds, and manufacturers are marketing them more like glamorous lifestyle vehicles than just workmans tools.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But a glamorous lifestyle vehicle will be quickly laughed off the building site if it can't handle more than a sprinkling of mud, and as Nissan has been making pick-ups for more than 80 years, it would be poor form if the latest Navara couldn't handle itself. Recent successes with the Qashqai, Juke and X-Trail means that the Navara&nbsp;pick-up is said to be a combination of these two knowledge bases: a tough, off-roading, working truck with the refined road manners of a crossover.</p>
