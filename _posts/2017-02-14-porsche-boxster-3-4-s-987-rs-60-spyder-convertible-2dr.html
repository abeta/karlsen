<p>Appreciating modern classic? With a limited run of 1960 vehicles Porsche created a fabulous limited edition. A good example is hard to come across.&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span id="RS60_Spyder" class="mw-headline">RS 60 Spyder</span></h5>
<p>In November 2007, Porsche announced a commemorative RS60 Spyder edition of the Boxster to celebrate Porsche's 1960 win in the 12 Hours of Sebring in Florida.&nbsp;Only 1960 units in this series were produced worldwide. With each model bearing a numbered production badge on the dash. The RS 60 Spyder comes in only GT Silver Metallic while the standard interior is Carrera Red leather, with dark gray leather as an option. The RS60 comes standard with 19&nbsp;inch Sport Design alloy wheels, Porsche's Active Suspension Management System, and a sports exhaust that boosts the engine output to 303&nbsp;PS (223&nbsp;kW; 299&nbsp;hp).</p>
