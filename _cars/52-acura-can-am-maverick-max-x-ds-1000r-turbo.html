<p style="text-align: justify;">The 2017 Can-Am Maverick MAX X ds 1000R TURBO side-by-side is powered by an industry-leading 131-hp Turbocharged Rotax 1000R engine, increasing its lead as the most powerful production four-seat side-by-side vehicle ever made. The MAX platform is popular with riders everywhere. A custom two-seat Maverick MAX X ds 1000R Turbo won the prestigious Best In The Desert Mint 400 race in its first year of production.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Updated 131-hp turbocharged Rotax 1000R V-Twin engine w/ high-flow design (TURBO only): The industry&rsquo;s lone four-seat side-by-side vehicle with a factory-installed turbocharger has been revised for 2016. Its class-leading performance has been upped to 131 horsepower and its torque curves enhanced. Adding larger injectors, increasing boost pressure and recalibrating the CVT are some of the significant updates.</p>
