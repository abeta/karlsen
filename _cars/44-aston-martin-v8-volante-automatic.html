<p style="text-align: justify;">Simply stunning. Karlsen Auto Design are plaeased to bring this Aston Martin V8 Volante to the international market.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1 of 439 made &amp; repatriated from California in 2006 and restored by Warren Classics including conversion to European specification. With&nbsp;BMIHT Certificate, original engine,&nbsp;1 Yr MOT.<br /><br />Launched at the October 1978 Birmingham Motor Show, the Fourth Series or Oscar India V8 (Oscar India being AM factory 'shorthand' for October Introduction) boasted a re-profiled 'power bulge' bonnet, subtly integrated rear lip spoiler and GKN alloy wheels. Little changed beneath its aluminium skin, the model utilised the same independent coil-sprung front suspension, De Dion rear axle, four-wheel disc brakes and power assisted rack and pinion steering as its predecessors. Predominantly allied to three-speed Torqueflite automatic transmission, the Tadek Marek designed 5340cc DOHC V8 engine was fed via quad Weber carburettors. Thus equipped, Autocar magazine found the Oscar India to be capable of 146mph and 0-60mph in 7.2 seconds. Cementing its Grand Tourer credentials, the model featured a smart burr walnut dashboard / door cappings and could be had in Fixed-Head or Convertible guises. Total carburettor-fed V8 Volante production amounted to just 439 cars.<br /><br />According to its accompanying British Motor Industry Heritage Certificate, this particular example was built to left-hand drive North American specification complete with Weber carburettors, automatic gearbox, cruise control and Avon tyres on 13th June 1980 and despatched a week later to Aston Martin Lagonda Inc, USA. Repatriated from California by Warren Classics during 2016, the V8 Volante has since been restored in their workshops (including conversion to European specification). Completely stripped of all components, the car was thoroughly assessed by the firm's chief mechanical engineer. The original engine (number V/580/5195/LFA) was given a cylinder leak down test and had its bores, timing chains, tensioners, idler pulleys, camshafts, tappets and valve clearances checked. A new water pump was installed and refurbishments carried out to the power steering pump, air-conditioning, starter motor and alternator. The intake manifold was soda blasted and a European specification air box fitted along with new exhaust headers and carburettor gaskets etc. The oil lines and coolers were renewed. All belts were replaced and electronic ignition installed.&nbsp;<br /><br />The brake system was overhauled with many components being gold cadmium or zinc plated and the wiring loom tested and repaired as necessary. The automatic gearbox and differential were inspected and tested. Opening panels were rehung to achieve better alignment and the bodywork rigorously prepared with any uneven areas being reprofiled with a 2-pack alloy filler. Polyester sprayed and primed, the exterior was painted in Imperial Blue while the engine bay and underside were finished in Satin Black. The brightwork was rejuvenated and the wooden fascia / door cappings re-polished. The interior was re-trimmed with Dark Blue-piped Parchment leather complimented by Dark Blue carpets and a Dark Blue Everflex roof. The instruments were checked and the alloy wheels refurbished. The following companies helped ensure that original specifications were adhered to: Nicholas Mee Ltd, Aston Martin Heritage Trust, Rikki Cann Ltd, JMB Services and Atspeed Racing. Recently exhibited at The Warren Classic and Supercar Show's Concours d'Elegance (September 2017), this decidedly smart V8 Volante is offered for sale with restoration file.</p>
