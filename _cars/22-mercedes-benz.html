<p>During this year's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.goodwood.com/grrc/event-coverage/festival-of-speed/">Goodwood Festival of Speed</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://autoweek.com/vehicles/mercedes-benz">Mercedes-AMG</a>&nbsp;unveiled the newest member of its&nbsp;<a href="http://autoweek.com/vehicles/mercedes-benz/AMG-GT">AMG GT</a>&nbsp;family -- the AMG GT-R. The latest weapon in Mercedes'&nbsp;arsenal takes what it's learned from the road-going GT and GT-S&nbsp;coupes&nbsp;and race-ready GT3 and brings it all together.</p>
<p>The hand-built DOHC 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 powering the GT-R sits in same mid-front position as the rest of the GT lineup, but churns out 74 hp more than the current top-performing GT-S. This bump brings the GT-R's total output to 577 hp. The two turbos spool to a maximum speed of 186,000 revolutions per minute and stop building boost at 19.6 psi. That air is then rushed through liquid-to-air intercoolers before it&rsquo;s stuffed into the engine.</p>
<p>All those ponies go to the rear 20-inch lightweight aluminum wheels by way of a seven-speed dual clutch transaxle. Nestled inside the transaxle is also a much-needed limited slip differential.</p>
<p>If you plan on tracking this, Mercedes has you in mind. The GT-R uses a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_sump" target="_blank">dry sump oiling system</a>&nbsp;to help keep the engine happily lubricated while cornering.&nbsp;</p>
