        position: London
        testimonial: 'I didn''t have time nor know the specification of my car to advertise it properly. Also I wasn''t sure where to advertise it as there are lots of websites. I was also worried about the money/Transfers etc and the timewasters calling me. Karlsen Auto Design wrote my advert and took a part exchange plus arranged Finance for the buyer. I didn''t have to do anything onlythe viewing and the deal was already sorted out. Excellent. '
