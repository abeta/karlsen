<p>Karlsen Auto Design has built its reputation upon organic growth. We have become the UK's leading authority on supercars and specialist vehicles.</p>
<p>Our vast network of contacts and industry knowledge has come from our founder Mr Fraser Karlsen, who's experience of all things vehicle related&nbsp;-&nbsp;be it financing, buying, selling or sourcing&nbsp;-&nbsp;is second to none.</p>
<p>In 2010, Fraser saw how the vehicle industry was not utilising the internet in an effective manner. Although it was accessible, he found it to be quite stagnant.&nbsp;He then set to task developing a route to market for specialist, performance and highly collectable vehicles, including investment pieces to be sold effectively worldwide.</p>
<p>With our now unprecedented targeted sales software, Karlsen Auto Design actively link UK and international buyers with financiers, investment portfolios, bonded warehouses, shipping services&nbsp;and insurance.</p>
