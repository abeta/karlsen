<p>Karlsen Auto Design has built its reputation upon organic growth. We have become the UK's leading authority on Supercars and many specialist vehicles.</p>
<p>Our vast network of contacts and industry knowledge has come from our founder Mr Fraser Karlsen, who's experience of all things vehicle related&nbsp;-&nbsp;be it Financing, Buying, Selling or Sourcing is second to none.</p>
<p>In 2010, Fraser saw how the vehicle industry was not utilising the internet in an effective manner. Although it was accessible, he found it to be quite stagnant.&nbsp;He then set I.T. Developers to task developing Karlsen Auto Design a system that puts them ahead of the competition.</p>
<p>Karlsen Auto Design created a route to market for specialist, performance and highly collectable vehicles, including Investment vehicles to be sold effectively worldwide.</p>
<p>With our now unprecedented targeted software, Karlsen Auto Design actively link UK and international buyers with Financiers, Investment portfolios, bonded warehouses, shipping services&nbsp;and Insurance.</p>
<p>Why not enquire should you wish to buy or sell such a vehicle try it for yourself.&nbsp;</p>
